# Church Admin Platform - Development Notes

## Important Configuration
- **Port**: This project runs on **PORT 3001** (not 3000)
  - Another Supabase project requires port 3000
  - All URLs should reference http://localhost:3001

## Project Context
- **Name**: Church Admin Platform (Plataforma CASA)
- **Database**: Uses existing CASA Supabase project
- **Tables**: All tables prefixed with `church_` to avoid conflicts
- **Theme**: Black and white branding for CASA church

## Key URLs (Port 3001)
- Church Website: http://localhost:3001/
- Admin Panel: http://localhost:3001/dashboard
- Auth Pages: http://localhost:3001/auth/login
- Accounting: http://localhost:3001/dashboard/accounting

## Supabase Connection
- Project: CASA (existing project)
- URL: https://sxlogxqzmarhqsblxmtj.supabase.co
- Tables share database with LMS project (use church_ prefix)

## Development Commands
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Plataforma CASA/church-admin
pnpm dev  # Runs on port 3001
```

OR from the web directory:
```bash

## Technical Details

### Deployment Configuration Issues
- **Monorepo Structure**: Uses npm workspaces (not supported by Vercel)
- **Packages**: web, database, shared (requires proper monorepo deployment)
- **Current Vercel Config**: Flattened structure loses architectural benefits
- **Solution**: Railway supports monorepos natively

### Database Tables Created
- `church_organizations` - Multi-tenant support
- `church_profiles` - User profiles with roles
- `church_accounts` - Chart of accounts
- `church_transactions` - Financial transactions
- `church_transaction_lines` - Double-entry lines
- `church_expense_reports` - Expense tracking
- `church_expense_items` - Expense details
- `church_meditation_sessions` - Meditation history (ready to create)
- `church_meditation_preferences` - User preferences (ready to create)

### Key Components
**Dashboard & Core:**
- `/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx` - Collapsible navigation
- `/components/church/Hero.tsx` - Landing page hero
- `/components/church/Header.tsx` - Public site header

**Accounting (Paused):**

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...

# OpenAI (configured in Vercel)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...

# Eleven Labs (for Phase 3)

```

### Important Notes
- OpenAI key added to Vercel but deployment blocked by monorepo issue
- All meditation components use 'use client' directive properly
- TypeScript strict mode enforced throughout
- Ready for Railway deployment tomorrow
